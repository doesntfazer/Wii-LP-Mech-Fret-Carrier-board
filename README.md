# Wii-LP-Mech-Fret-Carrier-board
A Wii Les Paul Mech fret PCB for the Frets, and the carrier board. These should be drop in replacements for the fret board and carrier board. Carrier board uses an RP2040 zero.

Frets use Choc V1 switches. I recommend using the pro reds or reds if you want to use the bracket.

Cherry MX switches for the strum. You can use whatever switches you want, But I would recommend using Box switches of some kind that are pretty heavy.
